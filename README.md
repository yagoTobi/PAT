# Web Application Development Course Projects

This repository contains all the practical work completed for the Web Application Development course at Universidad Pontificia Comillas ICAI.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Practica-1-Pagina-Web-Base - Introduction to hosting websites on GitHub Pages
![Telef贸nica GitHub Layout](./repo-images/Practical-1-Github-Pages.png)
- This project served as a refresher on building websites from the ground up using HTML and CSS.
- The objective was to create a site template inspired by a specific company and host it using GitHub Pages, establishing a basic skeleton layout to be expanded upon in later projects.

### 2. Practica-2-Bootstrap - Exploration of Bootstrap framework and template usage
![Telef贸nica GitHub Layout w/ Bootstrap](./repo-images/Practical-2-Bootstrap-Template.png)
- This project focused on Bootstrap, exploring its efficient CSS development and 12-column structure.
- Building upon the website from project 1, I incorporated a Bootstrap template and enhanced the site's appearance by studying documentation and applying sound structure and design principles.

### 3. Practica-3-API-Management - Fundamentals of API management
![Telef贸nica GitHub Layout w/ Bootstrap](./repo-images/Practical-3-ISS-API.png)
- This class covered API usage and documentation navigation. The project required developing a website (now incorporating JavaScript) that integrated two APIs.
- The resulting project combines the International Space Station's real-time location API with a weather API, allowing users to determine both the ISS's position and the weather conditions in that region.
- Starting with a basic website structure, I incorporated a sleek design using Bootstrap to enhance user experience and layout.

### 4. Practica-4-Springboot - API development using Spring Boot
![Telef贸nica GitHub Layout w/ Bootstrap](./repo-images/Practical-4-FORM.png)
- This practical delved deeper into CRUD methodologies for API development, using a Java back-end with Spring Boot.
- While Spring Boot may seem extensive for a back-end, it provided valuable insights into another tech stack and built upon my previous year's OOP classes.
- We developed a simple API allowing users to complete a personal details form for website sign-up, with the ability to retrieve information through a GET method without validation parameters on the same screen.

### 5. Practica-5-Springboot-Testing - Backend function testing in Spring Boot applications
- This project evolved from the previous one, adding form validation to ensure dates of birth, email addresses, and names adhered to valid formats using RegEx validation.
- We explored the implementation of unit tests and learned the importance of backend testing for maintaining uniform data across a database.

### 6. Practica-Final - Final Project

![Volta - Image 3](./repo-images/final-proj-3.png)
- For our final project, completed with a classmate over the course of a week, we developed "Volta" - an electric car charger rental service. The concept allows users to rent out or use electric car chargers for a fee, similar to a gig economy model.
- The site facilitates user and charger host registration, addition of chargers to the database, and booking of charging slots. It also features map functionality to display charger locations.
- This project synthesized all course learnings, incorporating Bootstrap templates, JavaScript, a Spring Boot back-end, and a custom API for front-end to back-end communication.

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains its own README in Spanish, providing more detailed information about each project.

## Prerequisites

For projects 4 onwards, ensure you have the necessary software to run Spring Boot, including Java and Maven. Earlier projects use standard web technologies.

## Installation

For Practicals 4 and later, please refer to the [Spring Boot installation guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot). The earlier projects require no special installation.

## Contributing

As this repository contains coursework, external contributions are not expected. However, feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
